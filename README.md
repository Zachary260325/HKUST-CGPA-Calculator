# HKUST-CGPA-Calculator
An excel that includes formula that converts HKUST CGPA into WES GPA and traditional 4.0 GPA.

## Disclaimer
This is only a tool and calculate results may not meet specific standards and the result also may be incorrect. I am not resposible for any possible mistakes and other problems if you use this calculator for any official application usage, including when they ask you to convert your GPA into 4.0 scale in applications. 

This is only a tool intended to help HKUST undergraduate students calculate what is the equivalent GPA of HKUST students, and get a better idea of how you are ranking among all international applicants when applying for graduate school outside of Hong Kong.

## Usage
Download the [HKUST GPA CALCULATOR.xlsx](https://github.com/Zachary260325/HKUST-CGPA-Calculator/releases/download/0.0.1/HKUST.GPA.CALCULATOR.xlsx) file, open it, enter your courses, grades and credit.
The first line I already gave an example, modify it into your own, and remember to copy the formula in each line.

Using Excel 2021, but no new features, hope no bugs existing.

## This tool is so simple!
Yes, you are right, just that I am busy with applications so I created it, and I wonder others may also have this need. No technical stuff, no coding, just a simple tool, as I didn't find any good ones when I searched through the internet.

Anyway, you can give a star if this tool is helpful, but not expecting any.
